# Virtual Vinyl Player

## General
Virtual Vinyl Player is software intended for listening to music and browsing through collections, in a virtual, three-dimensional space.

## Features
- Physics-based record browsing! It's almost like you're shifting through your collection with your *own fingers*.
- Automatic metadata loading! Just tell the software where your music resides, and see your library come to it's metadata-y life right before your eyes!

## Roadmap
